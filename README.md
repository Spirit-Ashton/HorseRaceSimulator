# HorseRaceSimulator
A Repository For The Horse Race Simulator Project, Contains both the textual and graphical version.

PART 1 *IMPORTANT*//////////////////////////////////////////

Part 1: The Textual Version is made to work in the control panel, NOT an IDE console.

However, some control panels may not support displaying 8 bit Unicode characters, one such control panel is the native windows CMD shell.

This is due to font limitations of the specific application, not the control panel itself.

Therefore, any terminals within IDE's or third party terminals (such as cmder) will have no issue displaying the Unicode.

In saying this, to be able to view the Unicode you have to initiate your shell instance with "chcp 65001", This changes the code-point format to be able to display the Icons.

Have fun racing!
